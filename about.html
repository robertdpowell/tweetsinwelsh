          My wife and I have chosen to put our young children through <b>Welsh medium education</b> despite being non-Welsh speakers ourselves.
          Of course this means that learning Welsh is now a <b>whole family adventure</b>, and I'm always on the lookout for resources that can help us to keep up with 
          our kids learning pace! 
          <br>
          <br>
          We both work full-time so don't have a great deal of time to invest in learning a new language, which I suspect is a common challenge 
          for parents like us. 
          <br>
          <br>
          So, I built this site as an <b>experiment</b> to see to what extent I can improve my Welsh reading skills and vocabulary through <b>daily translation of a bitesize piece of everyday Welsh</b>. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I hope it adds some value for you.
