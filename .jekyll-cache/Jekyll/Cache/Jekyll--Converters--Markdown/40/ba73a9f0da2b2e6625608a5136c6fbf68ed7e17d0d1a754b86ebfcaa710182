<p>A few months ago when the lockdown came into effect, our lives changed. As for everyboy else, our regular routine was turned upside down. Having chosen a Welsh medium education for our reception age child, my wife and I were now not only home-schooling but home-schooling through the medium of a language that we could bareley speak, read or write!</p>

<p>Panic began to set in. How are we going to do this? Should we just focus on English for now? What happens when she goes back in September - sheâ€™ll be behind! This wasnâ€™t the plan!</p>

<p>The school were (still are) doing a fantastic job of sending out resources to support her learning but even the most basic of books was a struggle for us to follow.</p>

<p>So I realised that I needed to accelerate.</p>

<h3 id="trying-to-find-the-right-resource-for-me">TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT RESOURCE FOR ME</h3>

<p>Both of us have been trying our best to learn the language since she started at her school last September. We both work full time and as other parents will understand, finding the time to learn is a real challenge. My wife prefers the more traditional and stuctured classroom based setting and enrolled in an evening class whereas I have been relying on online services such as LINK say something in Welsh that I can consume when I get a spare 10 minutes during the day.</p>

<p>The problem with my approach of couse is that I need to bring the discipline and structure, and with so many worklife/homelife distractions I found that I was sometimes going weeks without doing any Welsh at allâ€¦.</p>

<h3 id="creating-my-own-resource">CREATING MY OWN RESOURCE</h3>

<p>I needed to find a routine and a resource that helped enforce a discipline of daily Welsh practice. Something that I could fit in to 15 minutes a day. A resource that would give me a good return on investment.</p>

<p>And that is where the idea for tweetsinwelsh.com came from.</p>

<h3 id="why-tweets">WHY TWEETS?</h3>

<p>Tweets are a wonderful medium for learning a language.</p>

<ol>
  <li>They are short</li>
  <li>They are written in everyday language</li>
  <li>There are plenty of them</li>
  <li>They cover a wide variety of interests (music, sport, technoloy, the news..)</li>
</ol>

<p>So in an effort to improve my Welsh reading and vocabulary, I have committed to translating one tweet from Welsh to English every day.</p>

<h3 id="tweetsinwelshcom">TWEETSINWELSH.COM</h3>

<p>Tweetsinwelsh.com is where I am publishing this learning journey.</p>

<p>By sharing my learning journey online I hope that not only will it keep me committed amd disciplined  (2 weeks in now and still going strong!), but also that others find it of some use in their own Welsh learning journey.</p>

<p>A big thanks to everyone who has offered kind words of support for this little adventure so far.</p>

<p>Right, time to find todayâ€™s tweet to translate.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
