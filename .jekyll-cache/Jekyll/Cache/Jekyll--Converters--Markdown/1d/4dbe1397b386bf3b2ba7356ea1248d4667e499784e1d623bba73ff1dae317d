I"j	<p>A few months ago when the lockdown came into effect, our lives changed. As for everyboy else, our regular routine was turned upside down. Having chosen a Welsh medium education for our reception age child, my wife and I were now not only home-schooling but home-schooling through the medium of a language that we could bareley speak, read or write!</p>

<p>Panic began to set in. How are we going to do this? Should we just focus on English for now? What happens when she goes back in September - she’ll be behind! This wasn’t the plan! The school were (are still are) doing a fantastic job of sending out resources but we def</p>

<p>So I realised that I needed to accelerate.</p>

<p>Both of us have been trying our best to learn the language since she started at her school last September. We both work full time and as other parents will understand, finding the time to learn is a real challenge. My wife prefers the more traditional and stuctured classroom based setting and enrolled in an evening class whereas I have been relying on online services such as LINK say something in Welsh that I can consume when I get a spare 10 minutes during the day.</p>

<p>The problem with my approach of couse is that I need to bring the discipline and structure, and with so many worklife/homelife distractions I found that I was sometimes going weeks without doing any Welsh at all.</p>

<p>I needed to find a routine. A resource that helped enforce a discipline of daily Welsh practice that I could fit in to 15 minutes a day that would give me a good return on investment.</p>

<p>And that is where the idea for tweetsinwelsh.com came from.</p>

<h3 id="why-tweets">WHY TWEETS?</h3>

<p>Tweets are a wonderful medium for learning a language because</p>

<p>They are short
They are written in an everyday language 
There are plenty of them
They cover a wide variety of interests (music, sport, technoloy, the news..)</p>

<p>So in an effort to improve my Welsh reading and vocabulary, I have committed to translating one tweet from Welsh to English every day.</p>

<p>Tweetsinwelsh.com is where I am publishing this learning journey.</p>

<p>By sharing my learning journey online  this online I hope that not only will it</p>

<p>I also hope that it is a resource that helps others in their own learning journey.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has offered kind words of support for this little venture</p>
